# Privacy Policy for AI Bridge

Effective Date: December 30, 2025

AI Bridge is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use the AI Bridge browser extension and VS Code extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
AI Bridge is designed to be a local-only tool. 
- **No Personal Data**: We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.
- **On-Demand Capture**: The extension only captures webpage content (HTML snippets, selected text, URL, and Page Title) when you explicitly trigger the "Alt+Click" action.
- **Purpose**: This data is captured solely to provide context to your local AI chat interface in VS Code.

## 2. Local Processing Only
- **Localhost Communication**: All data captured by the browser extension is transmitted directly to a bridge server running on your own machine (localhost/127.0.0.1).
- **No External Transmission**: Captured data is never transmitted to, stored by, or processed on any external servers managed by AI Bridge or any third parties.
- **No Tracking**: We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any other analytical tools to monitor your browsing history or extension usage.

## 3. Data Storage
- **Configurations**: User settings (such as server URLs or custom whitelisted hosts) are stored locally using the browser's `chrome.storage` API and VS Code's local storage.
- **Captured Content**: Captured content is not persisted. It is processed in-memory and sent to your IDE.

## 4. Third-Party Services
AI Bridge does not share your information with any third-party services. The extension facilitates communication between your browser and your IDE. Any AI services you use within VS Code (e.g., GitHub Copilot) are subject to their own respective privacy policies.

## 5. Security
Because AI Bridge operates entirely on your local machine, the security of your data is protected by your machine's own security boundaries. We implement security validators to ensure that the extension only communicates with authorized local ports.

## 6. Children's Privacy
AI Bridge does not knowingly collect any information from children.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.
